Just as TurboETH is a robust and versatile Web3 App template, it is also a vibrant open-source community of Web3 developers and enthusiasts. We welcome and encourage contributions from anyone who is interested in helping to shape the future of Ethereum.

We offer bounties that primarily focus on the creation of impactful integrations and templates. These bounties are designed to enhance the ability of developers to interact with major protocols and applications on Ethereum, further strengthening our template.

## How to Claim a Bounty
We host our bounty board on [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/turboeth/main-space-4251/view/board-ljeoacey). To provide everyone with a fair opportunity and prevent duplicated work, each bounty is assigned to only one individual at a time. Once assigned, the developer has two weeks to complete the bounty. However, we understand the complexities involved and may extend this deadline based on the TurboETH team's approval.

### Steps to claim a bounty:

1. [Join our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MKYh9pg8Yq) and make your introduction in the #introductions channel.
2. Create an account on [Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/). With your account, you can express your interest in a bounty by clicking the `I'm Interested` button on the bounty card.
3. In your application, briefly outline how you plan to complete the bounty. Feel free to comment on the initial scope of the bounty and suggest any changes, if necessary.

### Candidate selection
The TurboETH team will review all applications and select the most suitable candidate to complete the bounty. Should you be selected, you will be notified via Discord.
The selection criteria include:
- Understanding of TurboETH integrations and a clear plan to complete the bounty.
- A history of contributing to open-source projects.
- Experience with the stack required to complete the bounty.

### Bounty development
Post assignment, a new Discord thread will be initiated under #engineering for all communications related to the bounty. The thread will serve as a platform to discuss the bounty's scope, share progress, and raise any questions that may come up during development.

### Bounty completion
The TurboETH repository follows a set of React and TypeScript conventions that must be adhered to. New integrations and features should comply with the same quality and documentation standards as the rest of the codebase. The TurboETH team will review the pull request and may request changes, if necessary. Upon approval, the bounty will be marked as complete and the reward will be dispatched to the developer.

### Bounty rewards
TurboETH is a proud recipient of [18,271.88 OP Tokens](https://mirror.xyz/kames.eth/pnWjQI3LmK5AThQTe9QiJyz-6b91lb61FMfk-dwrNyQ) from the Optimism Retroactive Public Goods Funding initiative. The OP tokens earned through this program form the primary source of funding for TurboETH bounties.
