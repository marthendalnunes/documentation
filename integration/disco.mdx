Disco is identity simplified and focused on:

- Interoperability: We are chain-agnostic and you can take your portable credentials anywhere!
- Privacy: You are given the tools to consent to how information is shared and with whom. PII (Personal Identifiable Information) data is never committed to public blockchains.
- Autonomy: You as the user, should be able to own your own data. You own your own keys and no central authority can revoke or censor this!

# Integration
