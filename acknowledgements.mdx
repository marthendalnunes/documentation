Original template was forked from https://github.com/wslyvh/nexth

Underlying wallet manage and design systems were changed, but the template is continuing to use the original folder structure, plus other developer experience optimizations.

Thank you @wslyvh 🙏

The Precedent design system was absorbed (https://github.com/steven-tey/precedent) into TurboETH. 

Muchas gracies @steven-tey 🙏

# Why TurboETH? Hybrid Applications!
TurboETH blends traditional Web2 application technologies with cutting-edge Web3 cryptographic primitives. 

Why? So developers can start building next-generation applications today.
