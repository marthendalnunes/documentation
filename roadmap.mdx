TurboETH is a Web3 App Template.

In the future TurboETH will be an **Open Source Web3 Build System** that supercharges developers with cryptographic primitives: 

- blockchains
- authentication
- identity
- storage
- access controls

The Web3 ecosystem is evolving. **Complexity is increasing.** We are moving towards a more complete future. We need to connect, coordinate and create a map of this new digital frontier.

Next generation Web3 applications will need access to shared infrastructure and systems:

- public key infrastructure
- verifiable credential schemas
- access control standards
- data stream models
- select disclosure hubs

## ❖ Open Source Web3 Build System
The next major phase for TurboETH is modules and plugins.

Web3 is global coordination system. We need a global interopability framework.

**Web3 needs its “*Wordpress*” moment.**

The Web2 Era Internet internet was defined by Open Source Content Management Systems like Wordpress and Drupal: driving adoption, innovation, and growth. Suddenly anyone with a Internet connection was able to launch a businesses, create community or just share their thoughts.

### Modular Architecture

Web3 spans everything from always-online blockchains, distributed storage to private decentralized identity.

We need an elegant and expressive build system to abstract the complexity of global coordination protocol.
