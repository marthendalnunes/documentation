⚡️TurboETH is a Web3 App Template.

In the future TurboETH will be an Open Source Web3 Build System that supercharges developers with cryptographic primitives: blockchains, authentication, identity, storage, and access controls.

## V0 - Plugin Architecture
The Web3 ecosystem spans everything from public blockchains to private decentralized identity.

TurboETH is focused on becoming a plugin based **Open Source Web3 Build System**. Enabling composition of core cryptographic primitives and Web3 protocols into a supercharged Web3 application.
