Creating a new integration for the TurboETH ecosystem can be an enriching experience. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you make the most of the Starter TurboETH Integration template and streamline the development process.

## Understanding the [Starter TurboETH Integration](/integration/utility/starter)
The Starter TurboETH Integration is designed to simplify the process of creating new integrations within the TurboETH ecosystem. It provides a structured, intuitive directory and clear guidelines to help developers create robust and scalable integrations, whether they're building complex SDK interactions, simple API integrations, or anything in between.

By utilizing the Starter TurboETH Integration template, developers can ensure they're adhering to TurboETH's best practices and standards, leading to more efficient development and easier collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Integrations Branch
Start by forking the [integrations branch](https://github.com/turbo-eth/template-web3-app/tree/integrations) of TurboETH. This will create a copy of the branch in your GitHub repository where you can safely make changes.

### Step 1: Copy the Starter Template

Start by copying the entire `/integrations/starter` directory. This will serve as a blueprint for your new integration. The directory already includes a file structure that's optimal for most integrations.

### Step 2: Customize Your Integration Directory

Replace the starter code with your integration code. Make sure you follow the same pattern and structure that's already evident in the `/integrations/starter` directory.

## Developing the Integration

### Step 3: Initialize Your Client

The `client/` directory is designed for any client initialization code that your integration requires. If you're working with a specific module or SDK, initialization should take place here.

### Step 4: Create Your Components

The `components/` directory is where you should create your React components. 'Read' components that display data from a contract and 'write' components that send transactions should be located here.

### Step 5: Manage Your State with Hooks

Inside the `hooks/` directory, you should place your custom React hooks. These hooks can help manage state updates and encapsulate the logic for interacting with Ethereum contracts.

### Step 6: Add Contract's ABI

Your contract's ABI should be placed inside the `abis/` directory. Each ABI should have its own TypeScript file.

### Step 7: Configuring Your Integration with wagmi-cli

The `wagmi.config.ts` file should hold the wagmi-cli configuration for your integration. Settings like the compiler version and optimization can be configured here. 

## Finalizing Your Integration

### Step 8: Update Your Integration's Entry Point

The `index.ts` file serves as the entry point for your integration. It should export all the hooks, components, and utility functions that your integration provides.

### Step 9: Document Your Integration

Finally, ensure that your integration is well-documented. In the `README.md` file, provide a clear explanation of your integration's purpose, usage, and any critical information a new developer or user should know.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create new integrations that are well-organized, easily understood, and effortlessly navigated by other developers and users. Happy coding!
