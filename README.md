# TurboEth Documentation

### 👩‍💻 Development

```
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```
mintlify dev
```

### 😎 Publishing Changes

Changes will be deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

You can also preview changes using PRs, which generates a preview link of the docs.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
